# chem_274b_final_project
The Chem274B_final_project folder contains files and directories associated with Chem274B - Software Engineering Fundamentals for Molecular Sciences (Fall 2024).
The purpose of this project folder is to create a simplified version of a banking system by designing the input, output and processing components for setting up the banking system. Working as a cross functional team, there are 4 main levels that were divided between 4 group members and worked on in the banking_system_impl.py file: 
James McTighe - Level 1
The purpose of level 1 is to create new accounts, deposit money into those accounts and transfer the money between 2 accounts.
Gary Patterson - Level 2
The purpose of level 2 is to support ranking accounts based on outgoing transactions
Harris Saeed - Level 3
The purpose of level 3 is to allow scheduling payments with cashback and checking the status of scheduled payments. 
Edurne Gonzalez de la Vega - Level 4
The purpose of level 4 is to support merging two accounts while retaining both accounts' balance and transaction histories. 
# Banking_system.py File
The banking_system.py file contains the standard structure, or boilerlplat functionality of the banking system code. 
# Tests Folder
This folder contains the Gradescope tests that each have a separate test file for each level. We will ensure that each test passes before moving onto the next level. 
# db_scr folder
Contains the database SQL files that are implemented in the banking_system_impl.py file. 
# chem_274B_fp.db 
This file contains the database SQL file used in the banking_system_impl.py file. 
# main.sh and run_single_test.sh
These shell script files contain commands for testing the test files using bash.
